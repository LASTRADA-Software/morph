# Compiler-cache launcher selection.
#
# Three launchers are supported, in preference order:
#
#   1. fastcache-cc — the launcher from the fastcached project. Its entries are
#      portable across checkout paths, so a CI runner and a developer working
#      from different directories share cache hits. It must already be installed
#      and on PATH. It is configured purely through the environment and caches
#      nothing unless FASTCACHE_ADDR / FASTCACHE_SOURCE_DIR / FASTCACHE_BINARY_DIR
#      are all set; the address defaults to fastcached's own port,
#      127.0.0.1:6674, and the two roots are injected here via `cmake -E env`,
#      because CMake already knows them. Selecting it is conditional on a daemon
#      actually answering there — see the probe below.
#   2. sccache — the usual third-party launcher, used when fastcache-cc is
#      unavailable or unconfigured. Supports shared (Redis/S3/...) caches.
#   3. ccache — the classic local cache, used when neither of the above applies.
#
# Launchers are wired in as compiler launchers, so CPM-/FetchContent-fetched
# dependencies get cached too. If a launcher is already set (e.g. via the
# command line or a preset), it is left untouched.
#
# This file is self-contained on purpose — it uses nothing but stock CMake and
# names no target of the project it sits in — so it can be dropped into another
# repository verbatim. Two things follow from that and must be preserved: it
# cannot use CPM or FetchContent (a consuming project may have neither, and here
# it is included before CPM is even bootstrapped), and it must never fail a
# configure, since a build that has no cache should still be a build.
#
# When none of the three is installed, -DFASTCACHE_AUTO_INSTALL=ON fetches
# fastcache-cc from GitHub Releases rather than leaving the build uncached; see
# the block below. To disable everything: -DUSE_COMPILER_CACHE=OFF.

# module auto-installs (fastcache-cc 0.1.0) still reads only the old pair --
# `strings` on the published binary contains FASTCACHE_SRCROOT and
# FASTCACHE_BUILDTREE and neither new name.
#
# Setting only the new pair is not a cosmetic mismatch, it disables caching
# outright and says nothing: measured against a live daemon, the new names give
# "0 cacheable" with every compile counted as `missing
# FASTCACHE_ADDR/SRCROOT/BUILDTREE`, while the old names give a miss then a hit.
# The module would look correctly configured and cache nothing.
#
# An unrecognised environment variable is ignored by either launcher, so
# exporting both pairs works with the released binary today and with a newer one
# that has completed the rename, without this module needing to detect which it
# is holding. Drop the old pair once no supported release reads it.

# Optional auto-install of fastcache-cc from this project's GitHub Releases.
#
# Vendored into another repository, everything above buys that repository
# nothing unless fastcache-cc is already on its PATH — a manual, out-of-band
# step on every new checkout and every fresh machine. With
# FASTCACHE_AUTO_INSTALL=ON this fetches the launcher itself: a prebuilt binary
# from the latest stable release, picked by host OS and architecture.
#
# Prebuilt rather than built from source, because building it would need a
# compiler, a build tree and several minutes at configure time — inside the very
# module whose job is to make compiling faster.
#
# Opt-in, because reaching out to the network during `cmake` is a meaningful
# change from "use what is already installed", and because it is what makes this
# module write outside the build tree for the first time. The binary is staged
# in a per-user directory shared by every repository and every build tree, so it
# is fetched once per machine and version rather than once per build.
#
# Nothing here can fail a configure. Every error path — no binary published for
# this platform, no network, a corrupt download, a binary that will not run —
# reports one status line and leaves FASTCACHE_CC empty, so selection falls
# through to sccache, then ccache, then no caching, exactly as it does today.
#
# That last property is why the download is deliberately *not* checked with
# `file(DOWNLOAD ... EXPECTED_HASH)`: a mismatch there is fatal even when STATUS
# is captured (measured), which is the one thing this must never be. The hash is
# compared by hand below instead — the same guarantee, minus the abort.
